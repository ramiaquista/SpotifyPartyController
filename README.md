# SpotifyPartyController

App with Python and Django in Back End side, and JavaScrpit / React on Front End side, it use Spotify API. It's an app to play/stop/skip a song with other friends. You have to vote to pass a song, the admin can set how many votes are necesary to skip the song or if only he can play/stop the song. I'm working on it to improve it! It was inspired on a video I saw on YT.
